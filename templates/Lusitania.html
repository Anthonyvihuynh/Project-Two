		<p>On the afternoon of 7 May, a German U-boat torpedoed Lusitania, 11 mi (18 km) off the southern coast of Ireland and inside the declared war zone.</p>
		<p>A second, unexplained, internal explosion, likely munitions she was carrying, sent her to the seabed in 18 minutes, with the deaths of approximately 1,198 passengers and crew (figures vary from records at the time).</p>
		<p>Because the Germans sank, without warning, what was a completely defenseless, officially non-military ship, killing almost a thousand civilians, many of whom were children, they were accused of breaching the internationally recognized Cruiser Rules.</p>
		<p>The Germans claimed that since it had been secretly carrying munitions, it was operating as a military ship.</p>
		<p>The sentiment regarding the sinking of the Lusitania helped propel the United States into World War 1 against the Germans in 1917.</p>
		<p>Wreck lies approximately 11 mi (18 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale Lighthouse in 300 ft (91 m) of water at 51°25′N 8°33′W.</p>

		<p>How does the sinking of the Lusitania compare to the sinking of the other well-known ship of the time, the RMS Titanic?</p>
